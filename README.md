Flor
======

Flor is a diagnostics and sharing system for the Machine Learning Lifecycle.
Flor transparently captures complete execution traces (CETs) and surfaces them as relational tables with minimal human guidance.
You can run SQL queries over CETs by annotating your code with log statements --- after your code executes.
Run your ML code with confidence: you won't forget to track something important.
When you need the value of some expression in your code, just click on it and give it a name, we'll do ETL.
Ask your questions in SQL.

Flor is a work in progress.
You are welcome to try it now and give us feedback via Github Issues.
We're working on making Flor run faster, without sacrificing completeness, transparency, or ease of use.
